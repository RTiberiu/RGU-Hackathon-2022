## Description

At the RGU Aberdeen Hackathon in 2022, I participated in a 24-hour challenge where I collaborated with a colleague to develop a 3D Battleship simulation game. During the challenge, I focused on learning the Three.js library, which enables 3D elements to be added to a website, and implementing all of the battleship and animation logic. My colleague was responsible for designing and implementing the player input interface and parsing the input to my functions.

Our goal for the project was to visually showcase known locations in a 3D space. We created a 2-player interactive game where each person takes turns trying to hit a part of the ship, accumulating points as they go.

Although the game has room for improvement, our primary intention was to showcase the 3D locations of each ship and to reveal their locations at the end, as this was the main aspect of the challenge. 

## Playing the game

To play the game, input the coordinates within the bounds of the cube in turns by pressing *Submit*, and earn points when a cube turns green.

Press *Finish* to trigger the animation that reveals the actual ship points and hides the meshes of the missing shots. This will display a full list of the shots taken and each ship's actual locations.
